# UDS WordPress Deprecation Helper

A plugin to be used in conjunction with the UDS-WordPress Theme](https://github.com/asu-ke-web-services/UDS-WordPress-Theme). Restores deprecated blocks and other functionality from older versions of the theme. Used as a temporary solution until proper content remediation can take place for sites already in production.

## Requirements

When installed the plugin will require the plugin Advanced Custom Fields Pro to be present in order to continue. ACF Pro is also a requirement of the accompanying theme. The plugin attempts to enqueue ACF blocks and uses an ACF options panel.

## Options

More documentation to follow regarding the deprecated elements contained within this plugin.
